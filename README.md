Transit Planning Tools for Medium-Sized Agencies

Welcome to the transit_planning_with_python repository! This collection of off-the-shelf Python scripts is designed to assist transit planners at medium-sized agencies. Each tool focuses on accomplishing a common task or solving a common challenge in transit analysis and planning. The most common input is static General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data, but shapefile roadway centerlines, roadway polygons, bus route shapes, Census blocks, and others are also commonly used.
